<h4>Phileleftheros Newspaper</h4>
- **Date**: Tuesday, 06 August 2024
- **Page**: 12
- **Description**: My research on innovative autonomous multi-agent systems for enhancing emergency response (project GLIMPSE) is featured in <b><a href="https://www.philenews.com" target="_blank">Phileleftheros</a></b>, the largest newspaper in Cyprus, with a daily circulation of about 26,000 copies. Established in 1955, it is also the oldest Greek-language daily newspaper still in circulation on the island. The article discusses groundbreaking research in autonomous multi-agent systems, distributed control, and artificial intelligence, utilizing a fleet of autonomous flying robots (drones). The aim is to revolutionize search-and-rescue operations, enhancing their efficiency and effectiveness. The research addresses numerous challenges in disaster response, including intelligent decision-making, accurate state estimation in uncertain environments, and efficient multi-agent cooperative control and planning for emergency response missions. The article can be accessed in Greek (i.e., the original version) [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/pdf/media_coverage_1.pdf %}), and in English (i.e., translated) <a href="https://www.kios.ucy.ac.cy/glimpse-innovative-autonomous-multi-agent-systems-for-enhancing-emergency-response/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h4>Yale Scientific</h4>
- **Date**: April 2012
- **Issue**: Vol. 85 No. 3
- **Description**: My research on understanding the energy consumption behavior of large buildings, identifying energy consumption patterns, and detecting novel events as part of the Intelligent Buildings project is featured in the <b><a href="https://www.yalescientific.org" target="_blank">Yale Scientific</a></b> magazine. Under the guidance of my supervisor, Prof. Andreas Savvides, I pioneered the creation of novel machine-learning techniques that learn a building's consumption behavior, adapt to changes in consumption patterns, and pinpoint anomalies. I developed a learning architecture that closely resembles today's modern Autoencoder Artificial Neural Networks (although this was conceived before the deep-learning and AI boom).
  
I gathered hourly power consumption data from Rosenkranz Hall, a 60,000 sq. ft. building at Yale that we had instrumented, and organized this data into daily segments (each comprised of 24-dimensional vectors), dividing it into training and test sets. By integrating Correspondence Analysis (CA), a dimensionality reduction technique, with Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) - a type of artificial neural network known for creating spatially organized internal representations of input features - I enabled unsupervised learning of a latent representation of normal power consumption patterns, which, in turn, facilitated the detection of novel events. In this setup, CA functioned similarly to the encoder part of an Autoencoder, enabling efficient low-dimensional representation of the input, while the SOM served a role analogous to the decoder, which is typically utilized in anomaly detection.
