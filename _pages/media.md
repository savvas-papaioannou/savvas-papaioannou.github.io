<h4>Phileleftheros Newspaper</h4>
- **Date**: Tuesday, 06 August 2024
- **Page**: 12
- **Description**: My research on innovative autonomous multi-agent systems for enhancing emergency response (project GLIMPSE) is featured in <b><a href="https://www.philenews.com" target="_blank">Phileleftheros</a></b>, the largest newspaper in Cyprus, with a daily circulation of about 26,000 copies. Established in 1955, it is also the oldest Greek-language daily newspaper still in circulation on the island. The article discusses groundbreaking research in autonomous multi-agent systems, distributed control, and artificial intelligence, utilizing a fleet of autonomous flying robots (drones). The aim is to revolutionize search-and-rescue operations, enhancing their efficiency and effectiveness. The research addresses numerous challenges in disaster response, including intelligent decision-making, accurate state estimation in uncertain environments, and efficient multi-agent cooperative control and planning for emergency response missions. The article can be accessed in Greek (i.e., the original version) [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/pdf/media_coverage_1.pdf %}), and in English (i.e., translated) <a href="https://www.kios.ucy.ac.cy/glimpse-innovative-autonomous-multi-agent-systems-for-enhancing-emergency-response/" target="_blank">here</a>.
