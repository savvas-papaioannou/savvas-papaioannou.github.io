I am a Senior Research Scientist at the <b><a href="https://www.kios.ucy.ac.cy/" target="_blank">KIOS</a></b> Research and Innovation Centre of Excellence, <a href="https://www.ucy.ac.cy/?lang=en" target="_blank">University of Cyprus</a>. I have obtained my DPhil (PhD) degree in <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> from the <b><a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank">University of Oxford</a></b>, where I was a member of <a href="https://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank">Kellogg College</a>. Prior to that, I completed my graduate studies at <b><a href="https://www.yale.edu" target="_blank">Yale University</a></b>, where I earned my MSc degree in <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/departments/electrical-engineering" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a>. I received my BSc degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering from the <b><a href="https://www.ece.tuc.gr/en/home" target="_blank">Technical University of Crete.</a></b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My <b>research endeavors</b> are centered around the development of innovative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory" target="_blank">estimation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory" target="_blank">decision</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control" target="_blank">control</a> techniques that will pave the way for the creation of intelligent autonomous systems. Recently, my research is focused on building the necessary mathematical frameworks for the design of intelligent multi-agent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle" target="_blank">UAV</a> systems that can be utilized in <a href="https://www.undrr.org/gar" target="_blank">disaster response</a> missions.
